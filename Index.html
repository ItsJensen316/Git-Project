    <h1>Advantages of Inheritance</h1>
    <ol style="font-size: x-large;" class="advantage">
        <li><strong>Code Reusability: </strong> allows for code reuse and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. The subclass can reuse the properties and methods of the superclass, reducing duplication of code.</li>
           <li> <strong>Abstraction: </strong>Inheritance allows for the creation of abstract classes that define a common interface for a group of related classes. This promotes abstraction and encapsulation, making the code easier to maintain and extend.</li>
           <li><strong>Class Hierarchy:</strong> Inheritance allows for the creation of a class hierarchy, which can be used to model real-world objects and their relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism: </strong>Inheritance allows for polymorphism, which is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. Subclasses can override the methods of the superclass, which allows them to change their behavior in different ways</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Disadvantages of Inheritance</h1>
    <ol style="font-size: x-large;" class="advantage">
        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Inheritance can make the code more complex and harder to understand. This is especially true if the inheritance hierarchy is deep or if multiple inheritances is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Tight Coupling:</strong> Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the superclass and subclass, making it difficult to make changes to the superclass without affecting the subclass.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: x-large;" class="advantage">
        <li><strong>Default superclass:</strong> Except Object class, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of the Object class.</li>
<li><strong>Superclass can only be one:</strong> A superclass can have any number of subclasses. But a subclass can have only one superclass. This is because Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. Although with interfaces, multiple inheritances are supported by Java.</li>
<li><strong>Inheriting Constructors:</strong> A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.</li>
<li><strong>Private member inheritance:</strong> A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods(like getters and setters) for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.</li>
    </ul>
